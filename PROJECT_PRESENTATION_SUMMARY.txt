   • Real-time analytics and KPIs
   • Performance metrics and trends
   • Chart types: Pie, Bar, Line graphs

5. SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION
   • JWT authentication with role verification
   • Password encryption using bcrypt
   • CORS configuration for secure API access
   • Input validation and SQL injection prevention
   • Secure session management
